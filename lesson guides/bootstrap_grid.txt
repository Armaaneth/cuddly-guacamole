One of the reasons why bootstrap became popular is because of the responsiveness. Responsiveness has always been a pain for developers generally and bootstrap changed the game. 

The reason why this is possible is because of  bootstrap grid. The bootstrap grid allows the webpage to be allocated to breakpoints that can be used by bootstrap. Responsiveness could only occur due to this breakpoints development. 

You can either alter the styles for each element while making the project responsive or you can remove certain elements altogether.

Bootstrap uses rows and columns and each row/ column has 12 units. For example,if I want to specify a particular style for a screen size larger than 1440px, I will specify my screen column as col-xxl-1. This is teeling bootstrap that this styling is for screens greater than your average 1440px screen.


Available breakpoints 
Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.

	Breakpoint	Class infix	Dimensions
	Extra small	None		<576px(Mobile phones)
	Small		sm		≥576px(Mobile phones with larger screens)
	Medium		md		≥768px(Tablets and ipads)
	Large		lg		≥992px(Tablets and ipads with larger screens)
	Extra large	xl		≥1200px(Desktops, Laptops and iMacs)
	Extra extra large	xxl		≥1400px(Desktops, Laptops and iMacs with larger screens)


Each breakpoint was chosen to comfortably hold containers whose widths are multiples of 12. Breakpoints are also representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions—they don’t specifically target every use case or device. Instead, the ranges provide a strong and consistent foundation to build on for nearly any device.

@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(lg) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(xl) { ... }
@include media-breakpoint-up(xxl) { ... }
